            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>8 ounces (about 225g) mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup (240ml) beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup (240ml) sour cream</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish</li>
            <li>Cooked egg noodles, rice, or mashed potatoes, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet or frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the sliced beef and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the beef from the skillet and set it aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, add a bit more oil if needed, then add the sliced onions and mushrooms. Sauté until the vegetables are softened.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic to the skillet and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir well to combine. Cook for another 1-2 minutes to remove the raw taste of the flour.</li>
            <li>Gradually pour in the beef broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Add the Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook until it thickens.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low, and return the cooked beef to the skillet. Allow it to simmer for a few more minutes until the beef is heated through and fully coated with the sauce.</li>
            <li>Stir in the sour cream and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, making sure not to boil the sour cream.</li>
            <li>Serve the Beef Stroganoff over cooked egg noodles, rice, or mashed potatoes. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley for added flavor and a pop of color.</li>
