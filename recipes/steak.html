        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 bone-in ribeye steaks (1 to 1.5 inches thick)</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
            <li>A few sprigs of fresh thyme or rosemary</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the steaks from the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature for about 30 minutes. Pat them dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and black pepper on both sides.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in an oven-safe skillet over high heat until it begins to smoke slightly.</li>
            <li>Carefully add the steaks to the hot skillet and sear for 2-3 minutes on each side until a golden-brown crust forms.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter, smashed garlic, and fresh thyme or rosemary to the skillet.</li>
            <li>Using a spoon, baste the steaks with the melted butter for about 1-2 minutes, allowing the flavors to infuse.</li>
            <li>Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and roast the steaks for 5-7 minutes for medium-rare or longer based on your desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Remove the skillet from the oven and let the steaks rest for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
            <li>Serve the butter-basted steaks with the infused butter sauce spooned over the top.</li>
        </ol>
